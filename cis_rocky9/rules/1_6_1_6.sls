# 1.6.1.6 Ensure no unconfined services exist

# Description:
# Unconfined processes run in unconfined domains

# Rationale:
# For unconfined processes, SELinux policy rules are applied, but policy rules exist that
# allow processes running in unconfined domains almost all access. Processes running in
# unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively. If an unconfined process
# is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system
# resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security
# enhancement on top of DAC rules â€“ it does not replace them
