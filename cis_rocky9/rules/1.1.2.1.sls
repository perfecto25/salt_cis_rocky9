# 1.1.2.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp
# Description:
# The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
# and some applications.

# Rationale:
# Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
# exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file
# system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless
# for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from
# establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the
# program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own
# copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker
# could continue to exploit the known flaw
